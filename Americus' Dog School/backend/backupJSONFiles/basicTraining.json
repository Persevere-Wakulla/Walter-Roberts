Next ask him to 'SIT' on something really comfortable, such as a thick rug, plush carpeting, or a pillow. Practice the SIT on the most difficult surfaces first, then move to medium, and finally easy surfaces several times a day.

Some dogs are leery of anyone of towering over them and associate your reaching with the end of their fun and time to go home.

After establishing a firm foundation for Come/Here on a six-foot leash, then use a longer leash, and go back and review all of the steps from the beginning. Some dogs will make great progress quickly, and others will need you to go much slower so that they can be successful. Gradually increase the length of the leash until your dog can turn away from what he wants (the foundation for coming when called) and come back to you easily, then progress to dropping the leash and letting him drag it, and eventually take it off while reviewing all the steps to teach Come/Here. Whe you first take off the leash, you might want to practice in a fenced or protected area in case you've hurried your dog's training and he runs off and won't respond.

If these opportunities are given as rewards your dog will learn that coming to you and checking in on a regular basis is a good thing.

Teaching your dog to Heel(walk at your side rather than drag you) requires lots of practice and repetition. Remember, pulling works, or has worked, for quite a long time for most dogs. A huge step in the right direction, therefore, is to stop following your dog when the leash is tight and she's pulling you. This might mean temporarily suspending all walks around the block so that she doesn't have the opportunity to practice pulling. Managing your dog's behavior by not allowing her to practice it isn't teaching her to walk next to you, but it's a step in the right direction since she isn't being reinforced for the wrong behavior.Since your dog has been pulling to get where she's going going for as long as you've had her, the behavior is firmly established. To train her to choose to walk next to you instead, you will have to do lots of repetitions with particularly yummy rewards. Whether you use treats like roast beef, cheese, or chicken, or favorite games like tug or fetch, the important thing is that the dog wants the reward more than she wants to pull.

There are two major variables involved in teaching your dog to Heel: the distance to the distraction and the intensity of the distraction (this has to do with speed, noise level, and quantity). By controlling the variables and working to slowly introduce distractions while you maintain your dog's ability to Heel, you will teach your dog to walk nicely on a leash regardless of the distractions around her. Keep in mind that if you can't get your dog to perform the behavior, you are probably too close to the distractions and she can't concentrate. If this is the case, back away from the action until you reach a point where your dog will preform the behavior well. Then, once you're certain your dog can handle it, you can bring her closer to the action. Here are some reminders to help you set your dog up for success.",

It will be a huge surprise to your dog when she is unexpectedly rewarded with a delicious treat or an awesome toy that you pull out of the bushes. By hiding goodies everywhere, you'll hold your dog's attention and keep her guessing about what you're going to pull out next. This will make you more intresting to your dog, and it will make her more willing to learn to walk with you."
