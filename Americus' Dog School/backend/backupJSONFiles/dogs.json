In the early nineteenth century these old Terriers were bred with the popular Otter Hound to combine the superior eyesight and hearing of the Terrier and the superior scernting ability of the Otter Hound all in one hardy, courageous dog. The cross was so successful that the resulting Airedale (named for the Aire River Valley) was shown in its own competition in 1879 at the Airedale Agricultural Society Show. The breed has flourished ever since because Airedales can adjust to so many various life-styles. They are the largest of the Terriers and perhaps more restrained than some of their cousins.",

      "trainingTip": "When Airedales are trained as young puppies, they learn quickly, easily, and willingly. They accept human dominance at this early age, which is important. If allowed to go untrained, an Airedale can become stubborn and difficult to control. This strong, independent spirit always needs a firm, decisive trainer.",

Airedales like to run and play a lot inside and outside until a stranger comes along, then they become aloof and distant. Airedales are territorial and may fight with strange dogs and therefore require early obedience training. They are usually polite to outsiders, both people and dogs, unless attacked. If they or their families are attacked, they are fearless. Despite the high energy level, the breed adapts to the city life-style well."

      "name": "West Highland White",
      "images": "dogs-195/44-west-highland-white-terrier.jpg",
      "origin": "Westies go back at least to the middle of the ninteenth century in Scotland. They come from the common Terrier stock of Scotland that gave us the Cairn, the Scottie, and the Dandie Dinmont. These all white Terriers were often known as Reseneath or Poltalloch Terriers after the estates of their breeders. Colonel Malcolm of Poltalloch had the name officially changed to West Highland White Terrier in the first decade of the twentieth century. The white coat was valued because the dog was much easier to see when hunting. The darker, earth-colored dogs could sometimes be mistaken for the vermin they were chasing, leading to tragic mistakes.",

        "females": "15-18 lbs."
      },
      "grooming": "Believe it or not that sparkling white coat is easy to keep. Too much bathing makes it more difficult. Dry shampoo and regular brushing keep the natural oils distributed throughout the coat and do more to keep the white color clean than soap does. Westies do not shed very much, but they have the Terrier hard outer coat and the soft undercoat that needs plucking when it loosens. Just gently pull the clumps of loose undercoat with the thumb and forefinger. It may take a little practice.",
      "cost": "Moderate",
      "capabilities": "A Westie can serve as a watchdog, hunter, or entertainment director. They are not good guard dogs. Not only are they too small, the West Highland White basically likes company and visitors, and though assertive, he is not an aggressive dog.",
      "trainingTip": "Unlike some other Terriers, Westies are not stubborn, so training is a reasonably simple, straightforward affair. These are very bright dogs. Just follow the basic training course.",
      "housebreaking": "This breed is easy to housebreak.",
      "aestheticQuality": "Alert, perky and white.",
      "personality": "Happy, active, sociable Highlanders enjoy life as long as they are loved, and who could not love them? Some Westies could be too impatient for a toddler or very young child. Like most Terriers, a Westie will only put up with so much. But older children and Westies are a perfect combination. This breed is very active indoors and needs to play a lot. They are very active outdoors as well. However, they make wonderful apartment dogs because they do not need an enormous amount of space for all that activity."

      "aestheticQuality": "Alert, clever, and playful.",
      "personality": "They need busy, active, older children who want to play. A fox Terrier's outdoor exercise does not have to be jogging, but he needs a lot of time to chase balls and see what's going on. Such active dogs need a fair-sized home in the city or country. Be sure to explain to the child and the dog that the child must be in charge at all times. Fox Terriers like to take over if given a chance. Fox Terriers are superstars. They are probably the most charming of all. These outgoing dogs do tricks and try anything to get your attention. However, they are highly sensitive and excitable and unbelievably active indoors. They are capable of driving your family quite mad with their energy, barking, and demand for attention. They are also quite scrappy with other dogs. Small children are usually not dominant enough, or fast enough, or alert enough to handle this breed. These dogs require a gentle-but-firm hand plus one who can outwit them. They are very clever, and quite stubborn. They are wonderful for older kids and teenagers."
