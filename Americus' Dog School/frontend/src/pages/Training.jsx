                <p className="theReasons">Ten Reasons People Give Up On Dogs</p>
                <p className="eachYear">Each year, hundreds of thousands of dogs arrive at rescue centers because their owners are no longer able - or prepared - to look after them. On average, about 25% are unwanted presents, another 25% have behavioral problems, and the rest are given up for domestic or other reasons. Here are some of the most common reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li className='giveUpDogs no-flex'> The breed was that year's "must-have" accessory(the "101 Dalmatians" factor).</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The cute fluffy little puppy was irresistible - but he didn't stay cute and little for long.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> Due to lack of training, the dog got aggressive, destructive, or uncontrollable.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The dog was acquired on impulse, usually to please children, before the owners realized the level of commitment involved.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The dog was left alone for long periods, barking and upsetting the neighbors, and/or becoming aggressive, destructive, or uncontrollable.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The elderly owners could no longer cope with the demands of dog ownership.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The expense of dog owning - feeding, neutering, veterinary treatment, boarding costs during vacation - got to be to much.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The marriage or relationship broke up and no one wanted the dog.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The overriding needs of a young family or the arrival of a new baby made dog ownership too difficult.</li>
                    <li className="giveUpDogs no-flex"> The owners moved to a new apartment with a "no pets" rule.</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="whyTrain">Why Train Your Dog?</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">A question a lot of people ask and wonder is why should I spend extra money I don't have nor do I have enough time to do it on my on.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">Why not just take care of my dog's physical, medical, and emotional needs, and let it go at that?</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">The Answer is CONTROL!!</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">No matter what breed of dog you own, the dog's life, your life, and the rest of your family's lives will be easier with a trained dog.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">One example when you take your trained dog out for a nice walk, he won't bolt after the nearest squirrel or start a mad dash after the neighbor's cat across a four lane road.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">You will bark, as it were, "Stay", and he will stop because you have anticipated his inborn reaction to a situation and primed to issue a command that he will understand and obey.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">A trained dog also may not fight with other dogs, and this is not insignificant - he won't use your house as a bathroom or your favorite recliner as a chew toy. What's more, you'll enjoy the dog, because you and he will be happier and have more opportunities to have a good time with one another.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">There are over 200 varieties of dogs and while all share similar characteristics because they have a common ancestor - the Wolf - all are different in some way, sometimes vastly different.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">Dogs come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors and have different instincts or traits that mandate different treatment.</p>
                <p className="trainingDog">Other factors involved in selecting a dog, such as sex, life span, cost, grooming and includes a very important factor - where to get your dog. Not all places are equal - far from it. Some are downright unethical, if not immoral and criminal, the chief sin being, over breeding dogs without regard to their healther well-being. The result is taht dogs are sold that are very poor examples of a breed or that have undesirable qualities, such as shyness or aggression.</p>
